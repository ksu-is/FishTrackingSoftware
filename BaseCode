*******************************
#First section of my code. What this does is it initializes the pygame, random, and math modules. 
Pygame installs game-like features to Python. This allows one to create a 2d space where fish can "exist". It provides shapes and sounds that one can utilize for the code.
Random is just a pseudo-random number generator which is useful for generating numbers to assign to fish.
Math just allows one to use simple arithmetic for tracking purposes.
