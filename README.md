# FishTrackingSoftware
###################################################

A software that is used to track species of fish within a small ecosystem. This may be within a confined, artificial space or a large pond/lake. This project will not be executed on a large scale at this time. 
Due to technological limitations, this software will primarly focus on tracking patterns of individual fish. The idea is that one will establish a confined space and will have the ability to track any movement within the space. When there is movement, the software will assign a character to the moving figure and continue to track it for as long as needed.
